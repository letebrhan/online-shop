This project is a simple yet fully functional online shop built with Django. It provides a custom dashboard for managing products and orders. Users can like products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Order processing is supported, but payments are handled using a fake payment system.

## Seeding the Database with Sample Data

### Option A — Management command (recommended)
```bash
python manage.py seed_products
```

### Option B — Fixture

python manage.py loaddata fixtures/seed_products.json
```

### Reset & reload demo data
```bash
python manage.py flush --noinput
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/seed_products.json
```

## Manager Dashboard Access

To access the custom dashboard for managers, use the following credentials:
- **Email**: `admin@admin.com`
- **Password**: `admin`

---

## Troubleshooting

- If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails with crispy-bootstrap4 / crispy-forms pins, use a compatible set (e.g., Django 4.2.x, django-crispy-forms 2.x, crispy-bootstrap4 ≥ 2024.1) or lock crispy-bootstrap4 to an older release compatible with Django 4.0.

- If `loaddata` fails with “no field named 'name'”, your models use different field names. Use the management command (Option A) or regenerate the fixture:
  ```bash
  python manage.py dumpdata shop.Category shop.Product --indent 2 > fixtures/seed_products.json
  ```
